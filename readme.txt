Genetic Algorithm Tool Kit - Jeremy Comer

This is a project that was started mostly as a self training exercise in Ruby.  The Joy of coding in Ruby kinda took over and it became more than i was orignally planning.  

What is it.  Basically a GA which has been designed to run under many different paramiters all of which are configurable from a sinlge config hash which and population is passed before starting evolution.

The Fitness functions which are present at the minute are just realtivly simple tests eg getting the ga to solve x,y,z in a simultainus equation.
More can be added and it is mi intention to allow fitness functions to be passed as blocks.
